My passion for IT started in the most unexpected way—while hiking deep in the woods, I stumbled upon what looked like a weathered laptop half-buried under moss and pine needles. No idea how it got there, but curiosity took over. I powered it up (with a bit of jury-rigged solar magic) and discovered lines of cryptic code—logs, maybe, or something more… wild. Ever since, I've been hooked.",
